# Description

This IPD (individual participant data) meta-analysis aims to explore the relationship between affective valence (as measured by the Feeling Scale) and exercise intensity (operationalized as a percentage of HRmax). With reference to the Dual-Mode Theory (DMT; Ekkekakis, 2003), we aim to identify sources of inter-individual variability.

According to the DMT, affective valence exhibits a quadratic decline with increasing exercise intensity due to the growing influence of interoceptive cues. In particular, within the "heavy domain," affective responses are suggested to show the greatest inter-individual variability, driven by the influence of cognitive factors. 

This figure illustrates the DMT (Ekkekakis et al., 2020):

# Summary Statistics

The dataset is inherently unbalanced, as it is derived from an exploratory meta-analysis that integrates data from studies with varying designs. To be included, studies were required to measure Feeling Scale (FS) responses and monitor the corresponding heart rate (HR) during aerobic exercise sessions lasting at least 10 minutes. Additionally, participant age was necessary to estimate HRmax. All additional variables that were available were provided to us at the discretion of the original study authors.
